## Introduction
The RISC-V EVM Experiment aims to bridge the gap between the RISC-V instruction set architecture and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By integrating RISC-V with the EVM, we seek to create a more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain VM platform.
With the vast target diversity of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, a VM such as this would empower developers to build smart contracts if various languages targeting RISC-V assembly.

## Project Goals
Our primary objectives include:
1. Developing a high-performance EVM implementation that utilizes the RISC-V instruction set.
2. Enhancing security through the use of RISC-V's advanced security features.
3. Improving scalability by leveraging RISC-V's parallel processing capabilities.

## Technical Approach
Our technical approach involves several key steps:
### Phase One: Designing a custom RISC-V EVM architecture.
1. Designing a custom RISC-V EVM architecture.
2. Implement RISCVIM32 assebler.
3. Implementing the EVM bytecode interpreter using RISC-V instructions.
4. Optimizing the EVM for performance and security.
5. Testing and benchmarking the implementation.

### Phase Two: Adapting Custom RISC-V EVM API to REVM API.
1. Implement custom RISC-V EVM using the REVM components
2. Testing and benchmarking the implementation.
3. Compile result for benchmark against the two implementations (custom RISC-V EVM and REVM)
